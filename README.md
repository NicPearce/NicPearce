### Hello, World!

I'm Nicole (or Nic, Nico, Nikki...) and I'm new to the Data Science industry. I have a background in Microbiology and Analytical Chemistry, and am in the process of completing a Master's of Science in Data Analytics from @wgu-edu. I work with the talented team of developers at Biolife Solutions, Inc.

I'm currently learning unsupervised machine learning models using SKLearn in Python.
